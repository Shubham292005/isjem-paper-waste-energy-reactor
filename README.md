**Innovation Title**: Waste Thermo Energy Reactor  
**Published In**: International Scientific Journal of Engineering & Management (ISJEM)  
**DOI**: [10.55041/ISJEM04883](https://doi.org/10.55041/ISJEM04883)

## 🔬 Abstract

The **Waste Thermo Energy Reactor** is a sustainable innovation designed to convert municipal, agricultural, and industrial waste into **thermal energy**, which is further converted into **electricity**. This system reduces landfill stress and helps in green energy generation.


## 📌 Key Features

- ♻️ Converts biodegradable & thermogenic waste into energy  
- 🔋 Powers small loads like LED lights, small electronics  
- 🌱 Environment-friendly: reduces carbon footprint  
- 📉 Low-cost prototype using recycled materials


## 🧪 Working Principle

The reactor uses combustion or decomposition of waste material to generate **heat**, which is then transferred via a heat exchanger to generate **steam** that powers a small dynamo or Peltier-based setup to produce **electrical output**.
